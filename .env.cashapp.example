# Cash App Pay Configuration Example
# 
# IMPORTANT: Cash App Pay requires a SEPARATE client ID from Square
# Even though Cash App is owned by Square, they use different client IDs
#
# To get your Cash App Pay client ID:
# 1. Log into Square Developer Dashboard
# 2. Go to your application
# 3. Navigate to "Cash App Pay" section
# 4. Get the specific Cash App Pay client ID (different from Square App ID)
#
# Production Cash App client IDs typically have a different format than Square App IDs

# Example configuration:
VITE_CASHAPP_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CASHAPP_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID_HERE
VITE_CASHAPP_ENVIRONMENT=production

# For local development with sandbox:
# VITE_CASHAPP_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CASHAPP_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID_HERE
# VITE_CASHAPP_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox

# To temporarily disable Cash App Pay, comment out the client ID:
# VITE_CASHAPP_CLIENT_ID=
