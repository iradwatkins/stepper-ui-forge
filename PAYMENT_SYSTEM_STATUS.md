# Payment System Status & Instructions

## ✅ Fixed Issues

2. **Database Schema Updated**

## 🚨 REQUIRED ACTION: Run Database Fix

**You MUST run the SQL fix in Supabase to make everything work:**

1. Copy the SQL:
   ```bash
   cat COMPLETE_FIX.sql | pbcopy
   ```

2. Go to Supabase SQL Editor:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/aszzhlgwfbijaotfddsh/sql/new

3. Paste and run the entire script

4. Wait 10 seconds for schema to refresh

## 📋 Testing Checklist

After running the SQL fix, test the complete flow:

1. **Test Payment Processing**
   - Go to http://localhost:8080/payment-test
   - Run diagnostics to verify all systems are green
   - Click "Test Checkout Flow" to add a test item

2. **Test Checkout**
   - Enter credit card details
   - Verify amount shows correctly (e.g., $52.00 not $0.52)
   - Complete the purchase

3. **Verify Ticket Generation**
   - Check browser console for:
     - "✅ Payment successful"
     - "Order created: {order details}"
     - "Tickets generated: [array of tickets]"
     - "📧 Email Service - Sending ticket confirmation"

4. **Check My Tickets Page**
   - Go to Dashboard → My Tickets
   - Verify tickets appear with QR codes
   - Test download and share functions

## 🎫 Ticketing System Overview

The ticketing system includes:

- **QR Code Generation**: Each ticket gets a unique QR code with validation data
- **Ticket Display**: Professional ticket view with event details and QR code
- **My Tickets Page**: Users can view all their tickets
- **Download/Share**: Users can download QR codes or share tickets
- **Email Confirmation**: Mock service logs email content to console
- **Validation System**: QR codes contain validation hash for secure check-in

## 📧 Email System Note

Currently using a mock email service that logs to console. To see emails:
1. Open browser developer console
2. Look for messages starting with "📧 Email Service"
3. Email content includes ticket details and QR codes

To implement real emails, update EmailService.ts with SendGrid, Mailgun, or Supabase Edge Functions.
