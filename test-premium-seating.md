# Premium Seating System - Testing Guide

## ✅ REBUILT PREMIUM SEATING SYSTEM

The premium seating system has been completely rebuilt from scratch with simplified, robust components:

### New Components Created:

1. **PremiumSeatingManager** (`/src/components/seating/PremiumSeatingManager.tsx`)
   - Handles admin seat placement
   - Canvas-based interaction with proper coordinate system
   - Progress tracking and category management
   - Auto-advance when all seats are placed

2. **CustomerSeatingChart** (`/src/components/seating/CustomerSeatingChart.tsx`)
   - Customer-facing interactive seat selection
   - Proper tooltip and hover states
   - Purchase flow integration
   - Real-time seat status updates

### Key Fixes Applied:

#### 🎯 **Coordinate System**
- Simplified percentage-based coordinate system (0-100%)
- Direct canvas coordinate calculation without complex transformations
- Consistent image aspect ratio preservation
- Click tolerance for accurate seat selection

#### 🎯 **Admin Side (Seat Placement)**
- **Category Selection**: Auto-selects first category, shows color preview
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows X/Y seats placed with progress bar
- **Auto-Advance**: Only advances when ALL seats are placed
- **Visual Feedback**: Category colors, placement indicators, zoom controls
- **Image Upload**: Proper Supabase storage integration

#### 🎯 **Customer Side (Seat Selection)**
- **Interactive Canvas**: Click to select/deselect seats
- **Real-time Updates**: Seat status changes immediately
- **Tooltips**: Hover for seat details (price, section, amenities)
- **Purchase Flow**: Integration with checkout process
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly drag and zoom

### Testing Instructions:

#### Admin Flow (Create Premium Event):
1. Go to `http://localhost:8081/create-event`
2. Select "Premium Event" type
3. Add ticket types (e.g., General: $50, VIP: $100)
4. Upload venue image in seating section
5. Categories auto-created from ticket types
6. Select category and click on image to place seats
7. Progress bar shows completion status
8. Only auto-advances when all seats placed

#### Customer Flow (Select Seats):
1. Go to event detail page
2. Click "Choose Your Seats" button
3. Interactive chart displays with venue image
4. Click seats to select (green = selected)
5. Hover for seat details in tooltip
6. Purchase button shows total price
7. Complete checkout flow
