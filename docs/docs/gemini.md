# Website Understanding: Q&A based on Codebase Analysis

This document provides answers to questions aimed at understanding the website's design and functionality, primarily based on an analysis of the existing codebase. Questions related to business strategy, specific design rationale not commented in code, user research, or future plans outside the current implementation may not be fully answerable from code alone.

## A. Project Overview & Goals

**1. Purpose & Value Proposition:**
*   **"What is the primary purpose of this website? What specific problem does it solve for its intended users?"**
    *   **Answer (from codebase analysis):** Based on the codebase, the website appears to be a platform for discovering, creating, and managing events. Key functionalities include event listing, event detail pages, event creation forms, user dashboards, and ticket sales/management (inferred from "reseller" and "ticket" mentions, and payment processing integration). It aims to connect event organizers with attendees and facilitate event-related activities.
*   **"What is the core value proposition that differentiates this website from potential alternatives or competitors?"**
    *   **Answer:** This information is not available from a direct codebase analysis. It relates to business strategy and market positioning.

**2. Target Audience:**
*   **"Can you describe the target audience(s) for this website? Are there defined user personas?"**
    *   **Answer (from codebase analysis):** The codebase suggests distinct user roles:
        *   **General Users/Attendees:** Browse events, view details, register, or buy tickets.
        *   **Event Promoters/Organizers:** Create and manage events, manage attendees/tickets, view event analytics.
        *   **Resellers:** Involved in ticket sales for events.
        *   **Admin Users:** Have oversight and management capabilities over the entire platform (users, events, etc.).
        *   **Employees:** A role with specific permissions, such as ticket scanning.
    *   Defined user personas are not present as artifacts within the codebase.

**3. Business Objectives:**
*   **"What are the key business goals or success metrics for this website (e.g., user engagement, conversion rates, specific tasks completed)?"**
    *   **Answer:** This information is not available from a direct codebase analysis. It relates to business objectives and analytics strategy defined outside the source code.

## B. User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI) Design

**1. User Flows & Journeys:**
*   **"Could you walk me through the main user flows? For example, how does a new user get started, or how does a returning user accomplish a key task?"**
    *   **Answer (from codebase analysis & existing documentation):**
        *   **New User (Attendee):**
            1.  Visits the website, likely landing on a homepage or events listing page.
            2.  Browses events (ref: `docs/website_functionality_overview.md`, section 1.1).
            3.  Filters events by various criteria.
            4.  Views event details (ref: `docs/website_functionality_overview.md`, section 1.2).
            5.  To register/save events, they would need to sign up/log in (authentication via `useAuth` hook).
        *   **Returning User (Attendee) - Finding/Registering for an Event:**
            1.  Logs in.
            2.  Browses/searches for events.
            3.  Views event details.
            4.  Interacts with components like `EventActions.tsx` or `EventTicketSection.tsx` to register/purchase tickets.
        *   **Event Promoter - Creating an Event:**
            1.  Logs in.
            2.  Navigates to a dashboard or "/post/event" (uses `EventForm.tsx` and `useEventForm.tsx`).
            3.  Fills out and submits the event creation form.
        *   **Admin - Managing Users/Content:**
            1.  Logs in.
            2.  Navigates to an admin panel (`src/components/admin/`).
            3.  Manages users, events, etc.
*   **"Are there visual sitemaps or user journey maps available?"**
    *   **Answer:** Not available from codebase analysis.

**2. Design Philosophy & System:**
*   **"What were the guiding principles for the UI/UX design?"**
    *   **Answer:** Not available from codebase analysis.
*   **"Is there a design system, style guide, or component library in place? If so, can you provide access or an overview?"**
    *   **Answer (from codebase analysis):**
        *   Uses **Shadcn/ui** components (`@/components/ui/`).
        *   **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
        *   Custom components in `src/components/`.
        *   No explicit "style guide" document, but conventions are driven by these tools.

**3. Accessibility:**
*   **"How was accessibility (e.g., WCAG standards) considered and implemented in the design?"**
    *   **Answer (from codebase analysis):**
        *   Full audit not possible from code alone. Standard HTML semantics are used.
        *   Shadcn/ui components generally offer good accessibility.
        *   Specific WCAG adherence requires dedicated testing. No explicit accessibility-focused modules beyond library defaults are evident.

**4. User Feedback & Testing:**
*   **"Has any user research or usability testing been conducted? What were the key insights or pain points identified?"**
    *   **Answer:** Not available from codebase analysis.

## C. Functional Specifications & Features

**1. Core Functionality:**
*   **"What are all the core features and functionalities of the website? A feature list or map would be helpful."**
    *   **Answer (from codebase analysis):**
        *   **Event Management:** Browsing, searching, filtering, detail viewing, creation, editing.
        *   **User Authentication:** Sign-up, login, logout, password reset.
        *   **User Dashboards:** Unified and role-specific (User, Promoter, Reseller) for managing events, tickets, profiles, notifications.
        *   **Promoter Tools:** Team management, event analytics, ticket scanner, scanner access management.
        *   **Reseller Functionality:** Invitations, event-specific reseller management.
        *   **Admin Panel:** User management, content oversight, platform settings, acting on behalf of users.
        *   **Other Content:** Articles, Stores/Shops (creation and viewing inferred).
        *   **Notifications System.**
        *   **Advertisements System.**
*   **"Are there different user roles or permission levels (e.g., admin, standard user, guest)?"**
    *   **Answer (from codebase analysis):** Yes. Guest (unauthenticated), Standard User (authenticated), Promoter, Reseller, Admin, Employee (e.g., for ticket scanning). Role-based access is evident from `profile.role` usage and hooks like `useAuth` and `useUserActingAs.ts`.

**2. Detailed Functionality:**
*   **"For key complex features (like event creation, user management, content submission), can you provide a breakdown of how they work, similar to the `useEventForm` documentation? This would include data models, validation rules, and interaction logic."**
    *   **Answer:**
        *   **Event Creation/Editing:** Detailed in the original `docs/gemini.md` (now this file, previously focused on `useEventForm.tsx`) and `docs/website_functionality_overview.md`.
        *   **User Management (Admin):** Involves fetching user lists, displaying info, actions like role editing. `useUserActingAs.ts` is key for admins performing actions on behalf of users.
        *   **Other Content Submission (Articles, Stores):** Likely use similar form patterns (`/post/article`, `/post/store`) with dedicated hooks, Zod schemas, and submission logic. Detailed breakdowns for each would require further documentation effort similar to the "Event Browsing & Details" section in `docs/website_functionality_overview.md`.

**3. Content Strategy:**
*   **"How is content managed and structured on the website?"**
    *   **Answer (from codebase analysis):**
        *   **Dynamic Content (Events, Articles, etc.):** Managed via Supabase database interactions.
        *   **Static UI Content:** Embedded in React components. No evidence of a dedicated i18n system for UI text.
        *   **Structured Data:** Defined by TypeScript types (`src/types/`) and Zod schemas.
        *   **Image Content:** Via image uploads, URLs stored in the database.

## H. Future Roadmap & Known Issues

**1. Planned Features:**
*   **"What are the planned future developments or features for the website?"**
    *   **Answer:** Not available from codebase analysis.

**2. Technical Debt & Challenges:**
*   **"Are there any known areas of technical debt, performance bottlenecks, or architectural limitations?"**
    *   **Answer (inferred from codebase):**
        *   `// TODO:` comments indicate minor planned work.
        *   Parsing `END_DATE`, `PROMOTER_EMAIL`, `PROMOTER_PHONE` from event description string in `useEventData.ts` is a potential area for refactoring (store as structured fields).
        *   Status of Square payments integration is unclear (potentially legacy/disabled).
        *   Fetching all events client-side in `EventsFilter.tsx` could be a performance bottleneck with many events; server-side pagination/filtering would be a future improvement.
*   **"What were the most significant challenges faced during the design and development that might impact future improvements?"**
    *   **Answer:** Not available from codebase analysis.

**3. Scalability:**
*   **"How was scalability considered in the design, and what are the current thoughts on scaling the application as user load grows?"**
    *   **Answer (inferred):**
        *   The stack (Vite, React, Supabase, Vercel) is inherently scalable.
        *   Supabase offers database scaling; Edge Functions are serverless. Vercel scales frontend hosting.
        *   Potential concern: Client-side filtering of all events (see "Technical Debt").
        *   Specific, detailed scaling plans are not in the codebase.

This Q&A provides a snapshot of the website's state and architecture as understood from the codebase. Deeper insights into strategy, non-code design decisions, and future plans would require input from the development team or project stakeholders.
