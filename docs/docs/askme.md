Okay, if I were interacting with Cursor AI (or any AI design tool) to understand a website it had designed, with the goal of making improvements, I would ask for information across several key areas. My questions would aim to get a holistic view, from the high-level purpose down to the technical specifics and future plans.

Here's what I'd ask Cursor AI:

**A. Project Overview & Goals:**

1.  **Purpose & Value Proposition:**
    * "What is the primary purpose of this website? What specific problem does it solve for its intended users?"
    * "What is the core value proposition that differentiates this website from potential alternatives or competitors?"
2.  **Target Audience:**
    * "Can you describe the target audience(s) for this website? Are there defined user personas?"
3.  **Business Objectives:**
    * "What are the key business goals or success metrics for this website (e.g., user engagement, conversion rates, specific tasks completed)?"

**B. User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI) Design:**

1.  **User Flows & Journeys:**
    * "Could you walk me through the main user flows? For example, how does a new user get started, or how does a returning user accomplish a key task?"
    * "Are there visual sitemaps or user journey maps available?"
2.  **Design Philosophy & System:**
    * "What were the guiding principles for the UI/UX design?"
    * "Is there a design system, style guide, or component library in place? If so, can you provide access or an overview?"
3.  **Accessibility:**
    * "How was accessibility (e.g., WCAG standards) considered and implemented in the design?"
4.  **User Feedback & Testing:**
    * "Has any user research or usability testing been conducted? What were the key insights or pain points identified?"

**C. Functional Specifications & Features:**

1.  **Core Functionality:**
    * "What are all the core features and functionalities of the website? A feature list or map would be helpful."
    * "Are there different user roles or permission levels (e.g., admin, standard user, guest)?"
2.  **Detailed Functionality (like the `useEventForm` example):**
    * "For key complex features (like event creation, user management, content submission), can you provide a breakdown of how they work, similar to the `useEventForm` documentation? This would include data models, validation rules, and interaction logic."
3.  **Content Strategy:**
    * "How is content managed and structured on the website?"

**D. Technical Architecture & Stack:**

1.  **Overall Architecture:**
    * "Can you provide a high-level architecture diagram showing the main components (frontend, backend, database, APIs, third-party services) and how they interact?"
2.  **Frontend:**
    * "What frontend framework/libraries (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte) and key patterns (e.g., state management, routing) are used?"
    * "What were the main considerations for the frontend architecture?"
3.  **Backend:**
    * "What backend language/framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django, Java/Spring) is used?"
    * "How is data persisted? What type of database(s) are in use (e.g., SQL, NoSQL)?"
    * "How are authentication and authorization handled?"
4.  **APIs:**
    * "Can you detail the API design (e.g., RESTful, GraphQL)? API documentation or schema definitions would be ideal."
    * "How does the frontend communicate with the backend APIs?"
5.  **Rationale for Tech Choices:**
    * "What were the key reasons for choosing this specific technology stack and architecture? Were alternatives considered?"

**E. Data Management:**

1.  **Data Models:**
    * "Can you provide details on the main data models or database schema (e.g., ERDs, schema files like Zod schemas from the `useEventForm` example)?"
2.  **Data Flow:**
    * "How does data flow through the system for critical operations?"
3.  **Data Integrity & Security:**
    * "What measures are in place for data validation, integrity, privacy, and security (e.g., GDPR compliance if applicable)?"

**F. Integrations:**

1.  **Third-Party Services:**
    * "What third-party services or APIs are integrated (e.g., payment gateways, analytics, social logins, email services), and how are they used?"

**G. Development & Operational Aspects:**

1.  **Codebase & Version Control:**
    * "Could you provide an overview of the codebase structure?"
    * "What version control system and branching strategy are used?"
2.  **Testing:**
    * "What is the testing strategy (unit, integration, end-to-end tests)? What frameworks or tools are used?"
3.  **Deployment & Hosting:**
    * "How is the website deployed and hosted (e.g., cloud provider, CI/CD pipeline)?"
4.  **Monitoring & Logging:**
    * "What tools and practices are in place for monitoring application performance, errors, and user activity?"
5.  **Security (Operational):**
    * "What security measures are implemented at the infrastructure and application level (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection, regular security audits)?"

**H. Future Roadmap & Known Issues:**

1.  **Planned Features:**
    * "What are the planned future developments or features for the website?"
2.  **Technical Debt & Challenges:**
    * "Are there any known areas of technical debt, performance bottlenecks, or architectural limitations?"
    * "What were the most significant challenges faced during the design and development that might impact future improvements?"
3.  **Scalability:**
    * "How was scalability considered in the design, and what are the current thoughts on scaling the application as user load grows?"

By asking these questions, I'd aim to build a comprehensive understanding that would allow me to identify areas for improvement, whether it's enhancing user experience, optimizing performance, improving maintainability, or adding new valuable features. The more detail Cursor AI could provide, especially through diagrams, documentation, and schema definitions, the better.
