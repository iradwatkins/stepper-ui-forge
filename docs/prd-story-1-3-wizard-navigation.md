## 2.0 Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current State Analysis
Based on comprehensive architectural analysis, the existing wizard navigation implementation is **40% complete** with significant gaps:

#### Critical Pain Points
1. **Poor Visual Indicators**: Basic linear progress bar provides minimal context about upcoming steps
2. **Inconsistent Navigation**: Different components implement navigation controls independently
3. **Limited Validation**: Users can navigate forward without completing required fields
4. **Mobile Experience**: Navigation breaks down on smaller screen sizes
5. **Accessibility Gaps**: Missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

#### Technical Debt Assessment
- **Component Decomposition**: Monolithic CreateEvent.tsx handles all navigation logic
- **Type Safety**: Missing TypeScript interfaces for wizard state management
- **Validation Architecture**: Form validation not integrated with navigation flow
- **State Management**: Basic useState without error recovery or context preservation

### 2.2 User Impact Analysis
Current implementation creates friction in the primary user journey:
- **Event Organizers** struggle to understand their progress through the creation process
- **Form Abandonment** occurs when users lose context about remaining steps
- **Mobile Users** experience degraded navigation on smaller devices
- **Accessibility Users** cannot effectively navigate the wizard using assistive technology

### 2.3 Competitive Analysis
Industry-leading event platforms provide:
- **Clear Step Indicators**: Visual breadcrumbs with completion status
- **Contextual Navigation**: Step-specific help and validation feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless mobile and desktop experiences
- **Accessibility Features**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
