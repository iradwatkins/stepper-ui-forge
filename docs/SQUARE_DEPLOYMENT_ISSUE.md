# Square Payment Deployment Issue

## Current Status
1. ✅ Edge function code updated with better error handling
2. ✅ Pushed to GitHub to trigger deployment
3. ⏳ Waiting for deployment to complete
4. ❌ Local `.env` has placeholder Square values (but this doesn't affect edge functions)

## Two Separate Issues

### Issue 1: Edge Function Not Yet Deployed
The improved error handling code exists in your repo but hasn't been deployed to Supabase yet.

**Solution**: 
- Wait for GitHub Actions to complete, OR
- Deploy manually via Supabase Dashboard:
  https://app.supabase.com/project/aszzhlgwfbijaotfddsh/functions/payments-square

### Issue 2: Square Credentials
Even after deployment, payments will fail if Square credentials aren't configured in Supabase.

**Edge Function Secrets Location**:
https://app.supabase.com/project/aszzhlgwfbijaotfddsh/functions/payments-square

**Required Secrets**:
- `SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID`
- `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID`
- `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT` (set to "production")

## Quick Deployment Check

Run this to see if deployment is complete:
```bash
curl https://aszzhlgwfbijaotfddsh.supabase.co/functions/v1/payments-square
```

**Old version** returns:
```json
{"code": 401, "message": "Missing authorization header"}
```

**New version** returns:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "gateway": "square",
  "environment": "sandbox",
  "configured": false,
  "apiStatus": "unknown",
  ...
}
```

## Action Items

1. **Deploy the function** (if not auto-deployed)
2. **Configure Square secrets** in Supabase Edge Functions
3. **Test payment** to see specific error
4. **Fix based on error message**
