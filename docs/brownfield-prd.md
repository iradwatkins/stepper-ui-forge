**Current Epic:** Epic 2 - Advanced Ticketing & Payment System  
**Completed Stories:** 2.1 (Ticket Configuration), 2.2 (Public Ticket Selection)

### Available Documentation Analysis
- âœ… **Epic 2 Comprehensive PRD**: Complete ticketing system requirements
- âœ… **Story 2.1 & 2.2**: Ticket configuration and selection implemented
- âœ… **Technical Architecture**: Supabase + React documented
- âœ… **Component Library**: shadcn/ui + ticketing components exist

### Current System State
- **Existing Checkout**: Single-item CheckoutModal.tsx (basic implementation)
- **Ticketing Components**: TicketSelector, TicketCard, QuantitySelector, PriceCalculator
- **Payment Integration**: PayPal, Square, Cash App ready
- **State Management**: React Query + React Hook Form
- **Database**: Supabase with ticket_types, events tables

## Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

### Story 2.3 Objective
Transform the single-item checkout experience into a comprehensive shopping cart system that allows users to:
- Add multiple ticket types to a persistent cart
- Modify quantities and remove items
- Maintain cart state across browser sessions
- Proceed through streamlined checkout flow

### Mobile-First Design Principles
- **Touch-friendly interactions**: Large tap targets for cart modifications
- **Minimal steps**: Reduce friction in cart-to-checkout flow
- **Clear visual hierarchy**: Price totals, quantities, and actions clearly visible
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show cart summary, expand for details
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for mobile screens first

## Compatibility Requirements

### Epic 1.0 Compatibility
- âœ… Simple events (no tickets) remain unchanged
- âœ… Existing event creation wizard preserved
- âœ… Basic event functionality maintained

### Epic 2.0 Integration
- âœ… Build upon Stories 2.1 & 2.2 foundations
- âœ… Enhance existing CheckoutModal.tsx without breaking changes
- âœ… Leverage existing ticketing components
- âœ… Maintain current payment gateway integrations

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing single-item checkout flow preserved as fallback
- No database schema breaking changes
- Current API endpoints remain functional

## Feature Requirements

### FR1: Shopping Cart State Management
- **Cart Context**: React context for global cart state
- **Persistence**: localStorage for cart data across sessions
- **Hydration**: Restore cart state on app load
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates on cart changes

### FR2: Add to Cart Functionality
- **From Event Detail**: Add tickets directly from EventDetail page
- **Multiple Ticket Types**: Support adding different ticket types for same event
- **Quantity Selection**: Choose quantities during add-to-cart
- **Validation**: Check ticket availability before adding

### FR3: Cart Management Interface
- **Cart Icon**: Navbar cart icon with item count badge
- **Cart Drawer**: Side panel showing cart contents
- **Item Modification**: Update quantities or remove items
- **Price Calculation**: Real-time totals with fees and taxes

### FR4: Enhanced Checkout Flow
- **Multi-item Support**: Handle multiple ticket types and quantities
- **Order Summary**: Clear breakdown of all items and costs
- **Payment Processing**: Support existing payment gateways
- **Order Confirmation**: Enhanced confirmation with all purchased items

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Cart Operations**: < 100ms response time for add/remove/update
- **Persistence**: < 50ms for localStorage operations
- **Checkout Flow**: < 2s payment processing initiation

### Mobile Experience
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px tap targets
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for 320px+ screen widths
- **Offline Resilience**: Cart state preserved during network issues

### Accessibility
- **Screen Reader**: Full ARIA support for cart operations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling in cart drawer

## Technical Integration Strategy

### Code Integration Strategy
- **Enhance**: Existing CheckoutModal.tsx for multi-item support
- **Create**: CartContext for state management
- **Create**: CartDrawer component for cart interface
- **Modify**: Navbar to include cart icon and badge
- **Enhance**: EventDetail page with add-to-cart functionality

### Database Integration
- **No Schema Changes**: Leverage existing ticket_types and events tables
- **Order Storage**: Utilize existing order handling or extend as needed
- **Session Management**: Use Supabase auth for user session cart persistence

### API Integration
- **Existing Endpoints**: Maintain compatibility with current ticket APIs
- **Inventory Checking**: Leverage existing ticket validation
- **Payment Processing**: Use current PayPal/Square/Cash App integrations

## User Experience Flow

### Primary User Journey

4. **Review Cart** â†’ Open cart drawer to review selections
5. **Modify if Needed** â†’ Update quantities or remove items
6. **Proceed to Checkout** â†’ Enhanced checkout with all items
7. **Complete Purchase** â†’ Order confirmation with all tickets

### Mobile-Optimized Interactions
- **Swipe-to-Remove**: Swipe cart items to remove (with confirmation)

- **Bottom Sheet**: Cart drawer slides from bottom on mobile

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- âœ… Building on proven Epic 2.0 foundation
- âœ… Existing payment integrations stable
- âœ… Component library mature and tested

### Medium Risk
- ðŸ”„ State management complexity across multiple components
- ðŸ”„ Cart persistence across browser sessions
- ðŸ”„ Inventory validation for multiple items

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development**: Build cart features progressively
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for cart operations
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Maintain single-item checkout as backup
- **User Testing**: Mobile-first testing throughout development

## Success Metrics
