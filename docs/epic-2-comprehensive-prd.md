- NFR6: API endpoints will handle 1000+ concurrent checkout requests without degradation
- NFR7: Mobile checkout experience will maintain current responsive design standards
- NFR8: Database queries will be optimized to prevent N+1 problems during ticket inventory checks

### Compatibility Requirements

- CR1: All existing Epic 1.0 Event Creation Wizard API endpoints must remain functional without modification
- CR2: Current database schema must be extended without breaking existing event and user data relationships
- CR3: Existing shadcn/ui component library and Tailwind CSS patterns must be maintained for UI consistency
- CR4: Current Supabase authentication flow must integrate seamlessly with new payment user flows

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

New Epic 2.0 UI components will extend the existing shadcn/ui design system, maintaining visual consistency with Epic 1.0's wizard interface. Components will leverage the established Tailwind CSS utility classes and design tokens. The shopping cart and checkout interfaces will follow the same multi-step wizard pattern used in Event Creation, ensuring users experience familiar navigation patterns.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

- **Ticket Configuration Screen** - Extension of Event Creation Wizard for organizers
- **Ticket Selection Interface** - Public-facing ticket browsing and selection
- **Shopping Cart View** - Persistent cart with item management capabilities
- **Checkout Flow** - Multi-step payment process with gateway selection
- **Order Confirmation** - Purchase summary with ticket delivery
- **Ticket Management Dashboard** - Organizer sales tracking and analytics

### UI Consistency Requirements

- All new components must utilize existing shadcn/ui primitives and Radix UI foundations
- Color schemes, typography, and spacing must match current Epic 1.0 design tokens
- Navigation patterns must follow established wizard-style progression with clear step indicators
- Form validation and error handling must use consistent messaging patterns
- Loading states and animations must match existing Epic 1.0 interaction patterns

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Frameworks**: React 18+ with Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components  
**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security enabled  
**Infrastructure**: Supabase BaaS with Edge Functions for serverless processing  
**External Dependencies**: React Query for server state, React Hook Form for form management, Zod for validation

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing schema with new tables (ticket_types, tickets, orders, payments, cart_items) while maintaining foreign key relationships to existing events and users tables

**API Integration Strategy**: Create new payment processing endpoints that complement existing event management APIs, utilizing established authentication middleware and error handling patterns

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Develop new components within existing component library structure, extending current wizard navigation patterns for seamless user experience flow

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Vitest/React Testing Library test suite with payment-specific test cases and mock payment gateway integrations

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: New Epic 2.0 components will follow existing src/components/, src/hooks/, and src/pages/ organization with epic-specific subdirectories (e.g., src/components/ticketing/, src/hooks/usePayment/)

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components, kebab-case for file names, following established patterns in Epic 1.0 codebase

**Coding Standards**: Continue using ESLint with TypeScript rules, Prettier formatting, and established import organization patterns seen in existing components

**Documentation Standards**: Extend existing TSDoc patterns for new functions and components, maintaining comprehensive type definitions and interface documentation

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Epic 2.0 features will build within existing Vite configuration without additional build steps or dependencies

**Deployment Strategy**: Incremental deployment using feature flags to enable Epic 2.0 components gradually while maintaining Epic 1.0 functionality

**Monitoring and Logging**: Payment processing will integrate with existing Supabase logging infrastructure with additional payment-specific event tracking

**Configuration Management**: Payment gateway credentials will be managed through existing environment variable patterns in Supabase dashboard

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: Payment gateway API changes could break integrations; real-time inventory conflicts during high-traffic sales  
**Integration Risks**: Shopping cart state conflicts with existing user session management; payment webhooks could overwhelm current API rate limits  
**Deployment Risks**: PCI compliance requirements may necessitate infrastructure changes; payment processing errors could impact existing event functionality  
**Mitigation Strategies**: Implement payment gateway abstraction layer for easy provider switching; utilize database transactions for inventory atomicity; deploy Epic 2.0 behind feature flags with gradual rollout; establish comprehensive payment error logging and rollback procedures

## Epic and Story Structure

Based on my analysis of your existing project, I believe this enhancement should be structured as a single comprehensive epic because the payment system components are tightly integrated and interdependent, requiring coordinated development to maintain data consistency and user experience flow.

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single Epic - Epic 2.0 represents a cohesive payment system where shopping cart, payment processing, and ticket generation must work together as an integrated whole.

## Epic 2.0: Advanced Ticketing & Payment System

**Epic Goal**: Implement a comprehensive multi-gateway payment system that seamlessly integrates with existing Epic 1.0 Event Creation Wizard, enabling organizers to configure ticket sales and attendees to purchase tickets through a secure, mobile-optimized checkout experience.

**Integration Requirements**: Direct integration with Epic 1.0 Event Creation Wizard for organizer workflow continuity; utilization of existing Supabase authentication and database infrastructure; extension of current React/TypeScript component architecture
