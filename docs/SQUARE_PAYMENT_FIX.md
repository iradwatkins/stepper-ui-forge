# Square Payment Error Fix

## Problem
Production Square payments were failing with generic "Internal server error" messages, making it impossible to diagnose the actual issue.

## Root Cause
The deployed edge function was an older version without detailed error handling. The improved version existed in the repository but hadn't been deployed.

## Solution
1. **Triggered Deployment**: Added version comment to `supabase/functions/payments-square/index.ts` to trigger GitHub Actions deployment workflow.

2. **Deployment Process**: GitHub Actions workflow automatically deploys edge functions when changes are pushed to main branch.

3. **Expected Outcome**: Once deployed (2-3 minutes), the Square edge function will return detailed error messages including:
   - Specific Square API errors (UNAUTHORIZED, INVALID_LOCATION, etc.)
   - Environment information (production/sandbox)
   - Configuration status
   - Base URL being used

## Next Steps

After deployment completes:

1. **Test Payment**: Visit https://www.stepperslife.com/payment-debug-test and click "Test Square Payment"

2. **Read Error Details**: The response will now show the specific Square API error

3. **Fix Based on Error**:
   - `UNAUTHORIZED`: Update SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN in Supabase dashboard
   - `INVALID_LOCATION`: Verify SQUARE_LOCATION_ID matches your Square account
   - `SANDBOX_NOT_ALLOWED`: Ensure using production credentials with production URL
   - `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS`: Token needs payment_write scope

## Configuration Location
Square credentials are stored in Supabase Edge Function secrets:
