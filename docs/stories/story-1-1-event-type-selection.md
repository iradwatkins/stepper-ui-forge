# Story 1.1: Event Type Selection Component Enhancement

**Status:** Done  
**Epic:** 1.0 Core Events System  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** 3 points  

## User Story
**As an** event organizer  
**I want to** choose between Simple, Ticketed, and Premium event types in a clear, intuitive interface  
**So that** I can select the right tier for my event needs with full understanding of each option's capabilities  

## Background Context
The existing CreateEvent.tsx already has a basic event type selection structure, but it needs enhancement to match the detailed requirements from Epic 1.0. The current implementation has the foundation but lacks the comprehensive features, visual design, and validation required for production use.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [x] **Visual Event Type Cards**: Display three distinct cards for Simple, Ticketed, and Premium event types
- [x] **Feature Lists**: Each card shows specific features included in that tier (as defined in Epic 1.0)
- [x] **Clear Pricing Indicators**: Simple (Free), Ticketed (Platform Fee), Premium (Full Features)
- [x] **Tier Comparison**: Visual comparison showing what each tier includes vs excludes
- [x] **Selection State**: Clear visual indication of which tier is selected
- [x] **Validation**: Prevent proceeding without selecting an event type
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
- [x] **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Should Have  
- [x] **Tier Upgrade Indicators**: Show what features user gains by upgrading
- [-] **Help Tooltips**: Additional context for complex features (deferred - not needed for MVP)
- [x] **Animation**: Smooth transitions when selecting/deselecting cards
- [x] **Preview Mode**: Quick preview of what the wizard steps will look like for each tier

### Could Have
- [ ] **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest tier based on user's previous events
- [ ] **Cost Calculator**: Show estimated costs for each tier
- [ ] **Feature Deep-dive**: Expandable sections with detailed feature explanations

## Technical Requirements

### Component Structure
```
EventTypeSelector/
├── index.tsx (main component)
├── EventTypeCard.tsx (individual tier card)
├── FeatureList.tsx (feature display component)  
├── TierComparison.tsx (comparison view)
└── types.ts (TypeScript interfaces)
```

### Data Schema
```typescript
interface EventType {
  id: 'simple' | 'ticketed' | 'premium';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon: ReactNode;
  price: 'Free' | 'Platform Fee' | 'Full Features';
  features: string[];
  limitations?: string[];
  nextSteps: string[];
}
```

### Dependencies
- **UI Components**: Card, Button, Badge, Progress from shadcn/ui
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons (UsersIcon, DollarSignIcon, MapPinIcon, etc.)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes
- **Validation**: Zod schema for event type selection
- **State**: React Hook Form for form state management

### Integration Points
- **Parent Component**: CreateEvent.tsx wizard container
- **Next Step**: Basic Event Information form (Story 1.2)
- **Data Flow**: Selected event type affects available wizard steps
- **Routing**: No routing changes, stays within wizard

## Design Requirements

### Visual Design
- **Card Layout**: 3-column grid on desktop, stacked on mobile
- **Selected State**: Border highlight, background change, checkmark icon
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with title, description, features
- **Color Scheme**: Follow existing Tailwind theme
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins using Tailwind spacing scale

### User Experience
- **Single Selection**: Only one event type can be selected at a time
- **Clear Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback on selection
- **Progress Indication**: Show current step in wizard progress bar
- **Error States**: Clear messaging if no selection made when trying to proceed

## Implementation Notes

### Existing Code Analysis
Current CreateEvent.tsx (lines 28-50) already has:
- ✅ Basic eventTypes array structure
- ✅ Event type state management
- ✅ Basic card components from shadcn/ui
- ✅ Icon imports from Lucide React

### Required Enhancements
- **Feature Lists**: Expand the current basic features arrays
- **Visual Polish**: Enhance card styling and interaction states  
- **Validation**: Add form validation for required selection
- **TypeScript**: Improve type safety with proper interfaces
- **Accessibility**: Add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

### Technical Constraints
- **Bundle Size**: Keep component lightweight, avoid heavy dependencies
- **Performance**: Ensure smooth interactions, no lag on selection
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (ES2020+), progressive enhancement
- **Mobile First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop

## Definition of Done
- [x] Component renders correctly in CreateEvent wizard
- [x] All three event types display with correct information
- [x] Selection state works properly with visual feedback
- [x] Form validation prevents proceeding without selection
- [x] Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- [x] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [x] Component integrates with existing React Hook Form
- [x] Visual design matches existing app theme
- [x] Manual testing completed on mobile and desktop

## Dependencies & Blockers
- **Unblocked**: Can proceed immediately
- **Dependencies**: None (foundational story)
- **Blockers**: None identified

## Test Cases

### Functional Tests
1. **Initial State**: Component loads with no selection
2. **Selection**: Clicking a card selects that event type
3. **Deselection**: Clicking selected card deselects (if allowed)
4. **Single Selection**: Selecting new card deselects previous
5. **Validation**: Cannot proceed without selection
6. **Form Integration**: Selected value integrates with React Hook Form

### Visual Tests
1. **Responsive**: Cards stack properly on mobile
2. **Selected State**: Clear visual indication of selection
3. **Hover States**: Appropriate feedback on hover
4. **Focus States**: Keyboard navigation highlights properly

### Accessibility Tests
1. **Screen Reader**: Cards announce properly with features
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order is logical
3. **ARIA Labels**: Proper labeling for assistive technology
4. **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG guidelines

## Future Considerations
- **Analytics**: Track which event types are most popular
- **A/B Testing**: Test different card layouts and descriptions
- **Localization**: Support for multiple languages
- **Advanced Features**: Dynamic pricing based on features selected

## Completion Notes
Successfully implemented all Must Have and Should Have requirements. Enhanced the existing event type selection with:
- Comprehensive EventType interface with proper TypeScript typing
- Rich feature lists for each tier based on Epic 1.0 requirements  
- Premium visual design with animations, selected states, and upgrade indicators
- Full accessibility support with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

Deferred help tooltips as they were not essential for MVP and added complexity without significant user value.

## Change Log
- Deferred help tooltips feature from "Should Have" to focus on core functionality
- Enhanced button text to include selected event type name for better UX
