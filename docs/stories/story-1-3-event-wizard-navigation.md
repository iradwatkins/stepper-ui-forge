# Story 1.3: Event Wizard Navigation Enhancement

**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Epic:** 1.0 Core Events System  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** 5 points  

## Story

**As an** event organizer  
**I want to** navigate through the event creation wizard with clear progress indicators and smooth transitions  
**So that** I understand what steps remain, can easily move between sections, and feel confident about my progress through the event creation process  

## Background Context
The existing CreateEvent.tsx has basic step management but lacks professional wizard navigation UX. Users need clear visual progress indicators, validated navigation, and consistent controls across all steps. The current implementation has inconsistent step numbering for different event types and minimal visual feedback about wizard progress.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

### Must Have
- [ ] **Visual Step Indicator**: Replace basic progress bar with professional step-by-step visual indicator showing all steps
- [ ] **Step Names & Descriptions**: Display descriptive step names and brief descriptions (not just numbers)
- [ ] **Completion Status**: Clear visual indication of completed, current, and pending steps  
- [ ] **Conditional Step Handling**: Proper indication when steps are skipped based on event type
- [ ] **Navigation Validation**: Prevent forward navigation without required data completion
- [ ] **Form State Preservation**: Maintain all form data when navigating between steps
- [ ] **Consistent Navigation Controls**: Standardized back/next buttons across all steps
- [ ] **Loading States**: Show processing indicators during navigation and validation
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Clear path back to fix validation errors with context preserved
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Navigation works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support with proper ARIA labels

### Should Have  
- [ ] **URL-based Navigation**: Step-specific URLs for direct access and browser history
- [ ] **Browser Navigation Support**: Handle back/forward browser buttons appropriately
- [ ] **Enhanced Auto-save**: Include navigation state in auto-save functionality
- [ ] **Mobile Gestures**: Swipe navigation support for mobile devices
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Arrow key navigation between steps
- [ ] **Progress Animation**: Smooth transitions between step indicators

### Could Have
- [ ] **Step Bookmarking**: Allow users to bookmark specific steps
- [ ] **Navigation History**: Show history of completed steps with timestamps
- [ ] **Advanced Validation Preview**: Show validation status for all steps simultaneously
- [ ] **Step-specific Help**: Contextual help for each navigation step

## Technical Requirements

### Wizard Step Structure
```typescript
interface WizardStep {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  component: React.ComponentType;
  isRequired: (eventType: EventType) => boolean;
  canNavigateForward: (formData: EventFormData) => boolean;
  canNavigateBackward: () => boolean;
  validationSchema?: ZodSchema;
}
```

### Navigation Flow by Event Type
- **Simple Events**: 3 steps (Type → Info → Review)
- **Ticketed Events**: 4 steps (Type → Info → Tickets → Review)  
- **Premium Events**: 4+ steps (Type → Info → Tickets → Review + future expansions)

### Step Validation Requirements
1. **Step 1 (Event Type)**: Must select one event type
2. **Step 2 (Basic Info)**: All required fields completed and valid
3. **Step 3 (Ticketing)**: At least one valid ticket tier (Ticketed/Premium only)
4. **Step 4 (Review)**: All previous steps completed and data integrity verified

### Dependencies

- **Form Data**: Preserves all form state from BasicInformation and EventTypeSelection
- **Auto-save**: Extends existing useAutoSave to include navigation state
- **Next Steps**: Prepares foundation for ticketing and review steps

## Design Requirements

### Visual Design

- **Progress Visualization**: Completed (checkmark), current (highlighted), pending (outlined)
- **Navigation Controls**: Consistent button placement and styling across all steps
- **Conditional Step Display**: Clear visual indication of skipped steps with explanation
- **Error States**: Inline step validation indicators with clear error messaging

### User Experience
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated transitions between steps with loading states
- **Validation Feedback**: Immediate validation feedback before allowing navigation
- **Progress Context**: Always show user's position and remaining steps
- **Error Recovery**: Easy navigation back to fix issues with preserved context
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation with proper focus management
