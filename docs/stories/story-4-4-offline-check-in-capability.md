# Story 4.4: Offline Check-in Capability

## User Story

As event staff,
I want the check-in app to work without internet,
so that entry can continue even with poor connectivity.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Check-in app functions completely offline after initial load
- [x] AC2: Local storage maintains ticket data and validation rules
- [x] AC3: Offline check-ins sync automatically when connection restored
- [x] AC4: Conflict resolution handles simultaneous check-ins
- [x] AC5: Clear offline/online status indicator
- [x] AC6: Local data cleanup prevents storage overflow

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: Service Worker handles offline requests properly
- [x] IV2: Background sync pushes offline data when online
- [x] IV3: Sync conflicts resolved without data loss

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Offline Architecture
- Service Worker for request interception
- IndexedDB for local data persistence
- Background Sync API for automatic synchronization
- Cache-first strategy for critical resources

### Data Synchronization
- Offline check-ins stored locally with timestamps
- Automatic sync when connection restored
- Conflict resolution for duplicate entries
- Retry logic for failed sync attempts

### Storage Management
- Local ticket data caching
- Periodic cleanup of old data
- Storage quota management
- Compression for large datasets

### Components Implemented
- `OfflineStorageService` - Local data management
- `SyncService` - Background synchronization
- `OfflineIndicator` - Network status display
- Service Worker with offline functionality

### Sync Strategy
1. Store offline actions in IndexedDB
2. Background sync when online detected
3. Server validates and merges data
4. Local storage cleanup after successful sync
