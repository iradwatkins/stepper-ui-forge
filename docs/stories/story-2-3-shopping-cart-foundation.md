# Story 2.3: Shopping Cart Foundation

## User Story

As an event attendee,
I want to add selected tickets to a shopping cart,
so that I can review my selections before purchasing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Shopping cart persists selected tickets with quantities and pricing
- [x] AC2: Cart displays running totals including taxes and fees
- [x] AC3: Users can modify quantities or remove items from cart
- [x] AC4: Cart state persists across browser sessions for logged-in users
- [x] AC5: Cart prevents adding more tickets than available inventory

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: Existing user authentication state integrates seamlessly with cart persistence
- [x] IV2: Database performance remains stable with cart operations
- [x] IV3: Cart functionality works consistently across desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Cart State Management
- Implement cart context using React Context API for global state
- Use localStorage for guest user cart persistence (24 hours)
- Use Supabase for authenticated user cart persistence (indefinite)
- Cart state includes: ticket items, quantities, pricing, taxes, fees, totals

### Database Schema
- Create `cart_items` table with fields: id, user_id, session_id, ticket_type_id, quantity, created_at, updated_at
- Add indexes for efficient cart lookups by user_id and session_id
- Implement TTL for guest cart cleanup

### Integration Points
- Extend existing TicketSelector component with "Add to Cart" functionality
- Create cart sidebar/drawer for ticket review and modification
- Integrate with existing authentication system for user session management
- Connect to existing ticket inventory system for availability validation

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [x] Integration verification completed
- [x] Unit tests written and passing
- [x] Component follows existing design patterns
- [x] Cart persistence works for both guest and authenticated users
- [x] Performance requirements met (no impact on existing operations)

### Completion Notes

Shopping cart foundation successfully implemented. Cart functionality was already well-developed in the codebase with comprehensive React Context state management, localStorage persistence for guests, and full UI integration. Added cart_items database schema for authenticated user persistence and comprehensive test coverage.
