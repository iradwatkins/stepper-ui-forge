# Story 2.6: Square Integration

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a customer purchasing event tickets
- I want to pay using Square
- so that I can use my preferred payment method with Square's secure payment processing

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Square gateway implements the PaymentGateway interface from Story 2.4
2. Square payment processing supports one-time payments for ticket purchases
3. Square integration handles authentication and authorization flows
4. Payment errors are mapped to standardized error messages using existing error handling
5. Square webhook integration processes payment confirmations and status updates
6. Square payment method appears as an option in the checkout flow
7. Square transactions are logged using the existing payment logging infrastructure

## Dev Notes

### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Payment Gateway Abstraction Layer (Story 2.4)
- Technology: TypeScript, existing payment infrastructure
- Follows pattern: PaymentGateway interface implementation
- Touch points: PaymentManager, checkout flow, cart system, configuration management

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- `/src/lib/payments/` - Payment abstraction layer location
- `/src/lib/payments/PaymentGateway.ts` - Interface to implement
- `/src/lib/payments/PaymentManager.ts` - Integration point
- `/src/lib/payments/config.ts` - Configuration management
- `/src/lib/payments/errors.ts` - Error handling system
- `/src/lib/payments/logger.ts` - Logging infrastructure

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- Square SDK integration for payment processing
- OAuth authentication flow handling
- Webhook signature verification for security
- Support for Square's sandbox and production environments
- Error mapping from Square error codes to standardized messages
- Support for Square's Web Payments SDK for frontend integration

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test (Test Location): location: `/src/lib/payments/__tests__/SquareGateway.integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/payment-flows/square-checkout.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Run `npm run dev` and navigate to checkout flow
- Select Square as payment method and complete test transaction
- Verify payment appears in Square dashboard
- Test error scenarios (insufficient funds, cancelled payment)
- Verify webhook processing with Square's webhook testing tools
