# Story 4.6: Duplicate Ticket Detection

## User Story

As event staff,
I want the system to alert me to duplicate or invalid tickets,
so that I can prevent unauthorized entry.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: System detects when same ticket is scanned multiple times
- [x] AC2: Clear visual/audio alerts for duplicate attempts
- [x] AC3: Invalid or tampered QR codes are rejected with explanation
- [x] AC4: Audit log records all duplicate/invalid attempts
- [x] AC5: Staff can override warnings with manager approval
- [x] AC6: Real-time alerts to security team for suspicious activity

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: Duplicate detection works in both online and offline modes
- [x] IV2: Audit logging captures all security-relevant events
- [x] IV3: Manager override system functions correctly
