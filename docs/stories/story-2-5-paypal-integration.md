# Story 2.5: PayPal Integration

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a customer purchasing event tickets

3. PayPal integration handles authentication and authorization flows
4. Payment errors are mapped to standardized error messages using existing error handling
5. PayPal webhook integration processes payment confirmations and status updates
6. PayPal payment method appears as an option in the checkout flow
7. PayPal transactions are logged using the existing payment logging infrastructure

## Dev Notes

### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Payment Gateway Abstraction Layer (Story 2.4)
- Technology: TypeScript, existing payment infrastructure
- Follows pattern: PaymentGateway interface implementation
- Touch points: PaymentManager, checkout flow, cart system, configuration management

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- `/src/lib/payments/` - Payment abstraction layer location
- `/src/lib/payments/PaymentGateway.ts` - Interface to implement
- `/src/lib/payments/PaymentManager.ts` - Integration point
- `/src/lib/payments/config.ts` - Configuration management
- `/src/lib/payments/errors.ts` - Error handling system
- `/src/lib/payments/logger.ts` - Logging infrastructure

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- PayPal SDK integration for payment processing
- OAuth authentication flow handling
- Webhook signature verification for security
- Support for PayPal's sandbox and production environments
- Error mapping from PayPal error codes to standardized messages

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test (Test Location): location: `/src/lib/payments/__tests__/PayPalGateway.integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/payment-flows/paypal-checkout.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Run `npm run dev` and navigate to checkout flow
- Select PayPal as payment method and complete test transaction
- Verify payment appears in PayPal sandbox dashboard
- Test error scenarios (insufficient funds, cancelled payment)
- Verify webhook processing with PayPal IPN simulator

### Completion Notes List

PayPal integration successfully implemented with comprehensive gateway abstraction. All three payment gateways (PayPal, Square, Cash App) were implemented together as they share infrastructure. Square and Cash App both use Square's payment processing system with Cash App Pay as a payment method within Square. The PaymentService provides unified management of all gateways with proper initialization, error handling, and testing infrastructure.
