## Dev Notes

### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Payment Gateway Abstraction Layer (Story 2.4)
- Technology: TypeScript, existing payment infrastructure
- Follows pattern: PaymentGateway interface implementation
- Touch points: PaymentManager, checkout flow, cart system, configuration management

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- `/src/lib/payments/` - Payment abstraction layer location
- `/src/lib/payments/PaymentGateway.ts` - Interface to implement
- `/src/lib/payments/PaymentManager.ts` - Integration point
- `/src/lib/payments/config.ts` - Configuration management
- `/src/lib/payments/errors.ts` - Error handling system
- `/src/lib/payments/logger.ts` - Logging infrastructure

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- Cash App API integration for payment processing
- OAuth authentication flow handling
- Webhook signature verification for security
- Support for Cash App's sandbox and production environments
- Error mapping from Cash App error codes to standardized messages
- Support for Cash App's mobile-first payment experience
- QR code generation for Cash App payment requests

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test (Test Location): location: `/src/lib/payments/__tests__/CashAppGateway.integration.test.ts`
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/payment-flows/cashapp-checkout.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Run `npm run dev` and navigate to checkout flow
- Select Cash App as payment method and complete test transaction
- Verify payment appears in Cash App developer dashboard
- Test error scenarios (insufficient funds, cancelled payment)
- Verify webhook processing with Cash App's webhook testing tools
- Test QR code generation and mobile payment flow
