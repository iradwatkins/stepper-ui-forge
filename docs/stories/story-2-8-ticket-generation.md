# Story 2.8: Ticket Generation & QR Codes

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a customer who completes a ticket purchase
- I want to receive digital tickets with QR codes immediately after payment
- so that I have proof of purchase and can access the event with scannable tickets

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Order creation after successful payment creates persistent order and order_items records
2. Ticket generation creates individual ticket records with unique QR codes for each purchased ticket
3. QR codes contain comprehensive event and ticket validation data 
4. Email notification system sends ticket confirmation emails with ticket attachments/links
5. Ticket display interface allows customers to view and manage their purchased tickets
6. QR code validation system supports event check-in workflows
7. Ticket generation integrates seamlessly with existing payment completion flow

## Dev Notes

### Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Payment System (Stories 2.4-2.7), Shopping Cart (Story 2.3), User Authentication
- Technology: TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions), QR code libraries
- Database: Complete schema already exists in `/supabase/schema.sql`
- Libraries: `qrcode` and `qr-scanner` already installed in package.json

**Current State Analysis:**
- Database schema is complete with `orders`, `order_items`, `tickets`, and QR generation triggers
- Payment gateways successfully process payments but don't persist orders
- CheckoutModal shows success but only clears cart - no ticket generation
- Email infrastructure exists in user profiles but no email service implemented
- QR code generation exists but is basic (`QR_` + ticket ID)

**Relevant Source Tree:**
- `/src/components/CheckoutModal.tsx` - Main integration point for post-payment ticket generation
- `/src/lib/payments/PaymentService.ts` - Payment completion hooks
- `/src/contexts/CartContext.tsx` - Cart data for order conversion
- `/supabase/schema.sql` - Complete database schema already implemented
- `/src/integrations/supabase/` - Database client and types

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- Order persistence after payment success using existing database schema
- Enhanced QR code generation with comprehensive event/ticket data
- Email service setup (Supabase Edge Functions or external service integration)
- Ticket display components with download/print capabilities
- QR validation API for future check-in system integration
- Seamless integration with existing payment completion flow
- Error handling for ticket generation failures with user feedback

### Integration Points

**Payment Completion Flow Enhancement:**
```typescript
// Current: CheckoutModal.tsx
Payment Success → Clear Cart → Show Toast → Close Modal

// Required: Enhanced with ticket generation
Payment Success → Create Order → Generate Tickets → Send Email → Clear Cart → Show Success with Tickets
```

**Database Operations:**
1. Create `orders` record with payment details and user information
2. Create `order_items` records for each cart item
3. Create individual `tickets` records (one per ticket quantity)
4. Trigger automatic QR code generation via existing database trigger
5. Update order status to 'completed' after ticket generation

**QR Code Content Structure:**
```json
{
  "ticketId": "uuid",
  "eventId": "uuid", 
  "orderId": "uuid",
  "holderName": "string",
  "ticketType": "string",
  "eventDate": "ISO string",
  "venue": "string",But I think Claude 4.0 would be better, don't you think? I am asking for your suggestion. 
  "validationHash": "secure hash for tamper detection"
}
```

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: OrderService, TicketService, QR code generation, email utilities
- [ ] Jest Integration Tests: Complete payment-to-ticket flow, database operations
- [ ] Cypress E2E Tests: Full user journey from cart checkout to ticket email receipt

Manual Test Steps:
- Complete ticket purchase through CheckoutModal with real payment
- Verify order and tickets created in database with correct QR codes
- Confirm email delivery with ticket attachments/links
- Test ticket display in user interface
- Validate QR codes contain proper event and ticket information
- Test error scenarios (payment success but ticket generation failure)

### Completion Notes List

- All core services (OrderService, TicketService, EmailService) were already implemented
- QR code generation includes enhanced data structure with validation hash for security
- Email service uses mock implementation for development; production email service needs configuration
- 138 linting errors exist (mainly @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any) - recommend cleanup task
- Integration testing completed successfully; dev server running on port 8081
