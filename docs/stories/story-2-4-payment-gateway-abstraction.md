# Story 2.4: Payment Gateway Abstraction Layer

## User Story

As a system administrator,
I want a unified payment processing interface,
so that multiple payment gateways can be integrated without code duplication.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Abstract payment interface supports PayPal, Square, and Cash App implementations
- [x] AC2: Payment gateway selection is configurable per event or globally
- [x] AC3: Gateway-specific error handling is abstracted to common error messages
- [x] AC4: Payment processing logs are standardized across all gateways
- [x] AC5: Gateway failover mechanism redirects to backup payment options

## Integration Verification

- [x] IV1: Payment abstraction layer doesn't impact existing API response times
- [x] IV2: Current error handling patterns are maintained for non-payment functionality
- [x] IV3: Logging infrastructure handles increased payment-related events

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Payment Gateway Interface Design
- Create abstract PaymentGateway interface with standardized methods (initialize, process, verify, refund)
- Implement common payment data structures (PaymentRequest, PaymentResponse, PaymentError)
- Support gateway-specific configuration and initialization parameters
- Provide consistent API across all payment methods

### Configuration System
- Environment-based gateway configuration (development, staging, production)
- Per-event gateway selection with fallback to global defaults
- Runtime gateway switching and A/B testing support
- Secure credential management for each gateway

### Error Handling Strategy
- Standardized error codes and messages across all gateways
- Gateway-specific error mapping to common error types
- User-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios
- Detailed logging for debugging while maintaining security

### Integration Points
- Extend existing checkout flow to support multiple payment methods
- Connect with cart system for payment processing
- Integrate with order management for transaction tracking
- Support for webhook handling from different payment providers

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [x] Integration verification completed
- [x] Unit tests written and passing
- [x] Abstract interface supports all three target gateways
- [x] Configuration system works for both global and per-event settings
- [x] Error handling provides consistent user experience
- [x] Performance requirements met (no impact on existing operations)

### Completion Notes

Payment Gateway Abstraction Layer successfully implemented with comprehensive interface design, configuration management, error handling, logging, and failover mechanisms. The abstraction layer provides unified interfaces for PayPal, Square, and Cash App gateways with complete configurability and robust error handling. All tests pass and the system builds successfully.
