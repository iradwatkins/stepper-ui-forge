# Database Cleanup for Production

## Current Database Schema Status

Your Supabase database has a comprehensive schema for an event ticketing platform with the following structure:

### Core Tables:
- **`profiles`** - User profile data (extends Supabase auth.users)
- **`events`** - Event information and settings
- **`ticket_types`** - Different ticket tiers/types per event
- **`tickets`** - Individual ticket instances with QR codes
- **`orders`** - Payment transactions and order tracking
- **`order_items`** - Line items for each order
- **`team_members`** - Event collaboration and team management
- **`event_analytics`** - Event metrics and analytics

### Additional Features (from migrations):
- **Cash Payment Support** - Handle offline/cash transactions
- **Inventory Management** - Track ticket availability and sales
- **Seating Management** - Reserved seating with seat mapping
- **Enhanced Team Management** - Advanced permissions and roles

## User Types in the System

Based on the database schema, here are the different user types:

### 1. **Event Organizers** (Primary Users)
- **Role**: Create and manage events
- **Permissions**: 
  - Create/edit/delete their own events
  - Manage ticket types and pricing
  - View sales analytics and reports
  - Invite team members
  - Process cash payments
  - Manage check-ins

### 2. **Team Members** (Collaborative Users)
- **Role**: Help manage events for organizers
- **Permissions** (configurable via `team_members.permissions`):
  - View event details
  - Manage check-ins
  - Process payments
  - View analytics (depending on role)
  - Manage attendees

### 3. **Event Attendees** (Ticket Holders)
- **Role**: Purchase and attend events
- **Permissions**:
  - Browse public events
  - Purchase tickets
  - View their own tickets
  - Update their profile
  - **Note**: Don't need accounts to buy tickets (email-based)

### 4. **Public Users** (Visitors)
- **Role**: Browse events without purchasing
- **Permissions**:
  - View public events
  - Browse event details
  - **No account required**

## Database Cleanup Steps for Production

### Option 1: Clean Slate (Recommended for Fresh Start)
```sql
-- Clear all user data while keeping schema
TRUNCATE TABLE event_analytics CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE order_items CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE orders CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE tickets CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE ticket_types CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE team_members CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE events CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE profiles CASCADE;

-- Reset sequences if any
-- (UUID-based tables don't need sequence resets)
```

### Option 2: Keep Test Data for Development
- Keep existing data for testing purposes
- Set `events.status` to 'draft' for all test events
- Mark test orders as 'completed' for testing analytics

### Option 3: Selective Cleanup
```sql
-- Remove only test/demo events
DELETE FROM events WHERE title LIKE '%Test%' OR title LIKE '%Demo%';

-- Remove old orders (older than 30 days)
DELETE FROM orders WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Remove unused profiles
DELETE FROM profiles WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT owner_id FROM events
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM team_members
);
```
