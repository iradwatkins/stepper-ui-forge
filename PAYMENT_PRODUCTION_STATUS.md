# Payment Production Configuration Status

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. Environment Variables Updated
- **Square**: Changed from `sandbox` to `production` in `.env`
- **Cash App**: Changed from `sandbox` to `production` in `.env`

### 2. Square SDK Fixed
- Updated `src/lib/payments/square-sdk.ts` to dynamically load production/sandbox SDK
- Previously hardcoded to sandbox URL
- Now correctly uses environment configuration:
  - Production: `https://web.squarecdn.com/v1/square.js`
  - Sandbox: `https://sandbox.web.squarecdn.com/v1/square.js`

## Current Status

### ✅ Production Ready:
- **Square**: Environment set to production
- **Cash App**: Environment set to production (uses Square SDK)
- **SDK Loader**: Dynamically loads correct environment

### ⚠️ Needs Configuration:
- **PayPal**: Still in sandbox mode
- **API Credentials**: Using placeholder values (need real production credentials)

## Required Production Credentials

To fully enable production payments, update these in `.env`:

### Square Production:
```
VITE_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your_production_app_id
VITE_SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_production_access_token
VITE_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_production_location_id
```

### Cash App Production:
```
VITE_CASHAPP_CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id
```

### PayPal Production (if needed):
```
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_secret
VITE_PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## Testing Production Mode

1. **Verify SDK Loading**:
   - Check browser console for: "✅ Square Web SDK loaded successfully (Production)"

2. **Test Payment Flow**:
   - Visit `/payment-test` page
   - Try creating a test event with tickets
   - Verify payment forms load correctly

3. **Monitor Errors**:
   - Production requires valid API credentials
   - Check browser console for authentication errors

## Important Notes

- Production mode requires valid production API credentials
- Test thoroughly before going live
- Consider using sandbox for development/testing
- Production transactions will charge real money

## Rollback Instructions

To revert to sandbox mode:
1. Edit `.env`:
   - `VITE_SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox`
   - `VITE_CASHAPP_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
