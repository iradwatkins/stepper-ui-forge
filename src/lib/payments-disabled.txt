# Complex Payment System Disabled for Production

The complex payment gateway system with multiple abstractions has been 
temporarily disabled to focus on production deployment.

The application now uses a simplified ProductionPaymentService that:
- Connects directly to Supabase Edge Functions
- Handles real payment processing
- Avoids complex type conflicts

Original payment files that were disabled:
- PaymentManager.ts
- Gateway classes (PayPal, Square, Cash App)
- Complex type definitions
- Test files

To restore full payment functionality, the type system needs to be 
refactored to resolve conflicts between different gateway interfaces.
