# 🌐 localhost:8080 Alternative Solution

## ❌ Problem: macOS localhost Connectivity Issue
Your macOS system is blocking connections to localhost:8080 due to security restrictions or firewall settings.

## ✅ Solution: Use Network IP Instead

Your development server is running and accessible at:

### **PRIMARY URL (USE THIS):**
**http://192.168.86.30:8080**

### **Backup URLs:**
- http://127.0.0.1:8080 (sometimes works when localhost doesn't)
- Direct IP access bypasses localhost restrictions

## 🔧 Why This Works:
- Vite is binding to `0.0.0.0:8080` (all interfaces)
- Your network IP `192.168.86.30` is accessible
- This bypasses macOS localhost blocking issues

## 🔍 Testing Your Payment Environment:

1. **Open**: http://192.168.86.30:8080
2. **Developer Tools** (F12) → **Console**
3. **Look for**:
   - `🔐 Payment Config Loaded:` (should show production)
   - `🟦 Square SDK Initialization` (should show production URL)
   - `🔍 RAW ENV VARIABLES:` (verify environment variables)

## 🎯 Expected Results:
- ✅ No "environment mismatch" errors
- ✅ Square SDK loads from `web.squarecdn.com` (production)
- ✅ Cash App loads from `kit.cash.app` (production)
- ✅ Database functions work (no 404 errors)

## 📋 Status Summary:
- ✅ Fixed hardcoded sandbox URL in index.html
- ✅ Enhanced environment detection logging
- ✅ Database schema updated
- ✅ Server running on all interfaces

**Use http://192.168.86.30:8080 to access your application!**
