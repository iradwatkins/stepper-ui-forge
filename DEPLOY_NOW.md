# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Manual Deployment Required

The GitHub Actions deployment seems to be having issues. Please deploy manually:

## Deploy Square Edge Function NOW:

1. **Go to Supabase Functions**: 
   https://app.supabase.com/project/aszzhlgwfbijaotfddsh/functions

2. **Click on `payments-square`**

3. **Click the "Deploy" button** (blue button, usually top-right)

4. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for deployment to complete

## Verify Deployment:

Run this command:
```bash
./scripts/test-square-health.sh
```

You should see `apiStatus` in the response if the new version is deployed.

## Why This Is Important:

- Current version swallows all errors
- New version will show exact Square API errors
- Will reveal if it's a credential, environment, or permission issue
- Essential for fixing the payment problem

## After Deployment:

1. Test at: https://www.stepperslife.com/payment-debug-test
2. You'll see specific errors like "UNAUTHORIZED" or "INVALID_LOCATION"
3. We can then fix the exact issue
