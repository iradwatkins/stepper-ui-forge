# **steppers.com - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

The goal of the MVP is to launch the simplest version of the platform that proves the core business loop: an organizer can create a basic event, and an attendee can buy a ticket for it.

### **Core MVP Features:**

1.  **User Authentication (Organizers Only):**
    * Organizers can sign up and log in.
    * Uses **Supabase Auth**.

2.  **Simplified Event Creation (Ticketed Events Only):**
    * A simplified version of the **Event Creation Wizard** (from Epic 1.0).
    * Organizers can create **Ticketed** events only. The options for "Simple" and "Premium" will be disabled or hidden.
    * Must include: Title, Date, Location, and at least one Ticket Tier (e.g., "General Admission") with a price and quantity.

3.  **Public Event Discovery (No Filters):**
    * A public `/events` page that lists all "Published" events (from Epic 1.0).
    * The MVP will not include search or filtering capabilities. It will be a simple grid of all available events.

4.  **Basic Ticketing & Checkout (PayPal Only):**
    * Users can click "Buy Ticket" on an event.
    * A simple checkout flow (from Epic 2.0) that integrates with **PayPal** as the sole initial payment provider.
    * Upon successful payment, the user receives a confirmation email (via a Supabase Function).
