# Payment System Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Early Bird Pricing Fixed
- **Problem**: Early bird prices were not being applied when adding tickets to cart
- **Solution**: Modified `addItem` function in CartContext to check early bird dates and use the correct price
- **Location**: `/src/contexts/CartContext.tsx` line 265-272

### 2. Price Conversion Fixed  
- **Problem**: Prices showing as $0.52 instead of $52.00
- **Solution**: Convert dollar amounts to cents by multiplying by 100
- **Location**: `/src/components/CheckoutModal.tsx` line 160

### 3. Database Schema Fixed
- **Problem**: Missing columns causing errors:
  - `events.organizer_id` column missing
  - `ticket_logs` table missing
  - Order creation failing due to RLS policies
- **Solution**: Updated `COMPLETE_FIX.sql` to add all missing columns and tables

### 4. My Tickets Page Fixed
- **Problem**: Query failing due to incorrect filter syntax
- **Solution**: Fixed `getTicketsByUser` to properly query tickets by user's order emails
- **Location**: `/src/lib/services/TicketService.ts` line 206-253

## üö® REQUIRED ACTION

**You MUST run the updated SQL script to fix all database issues:**

1. Copy the SQL:
   ```bash
   cat COMPLETE_FIX.sql | pbcopy
   ```

2. Go to Supabase SQL Editor:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/aszzhlgwfbijaotfddsh/sql/new

3. Paste and run the ENTIRE script

4. Wait 10 seconds for schema to refresh

## üìã Testing After SQL Fix

   - Add tickets to cart before early bird deadline
   - Verify discounted price is applied

2. **Test My Tickets Page**:

   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí My Tickets
   - Verify tickets appear with QR codes

3. **Test Complete Flow**:

   - Check console for email logs
   - Verify tickets in My Tickets page

## üîß If Issues Persist

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload
2. **Check browser console** for specific errors

4. **Test in incognito mode** to rule out cache issues

The payment system should now be fully functional with early bird pricing, correct amounts, and ticket display!
