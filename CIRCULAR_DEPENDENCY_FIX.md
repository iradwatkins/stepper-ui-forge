# Circular Dependency Fix - Image Rendering Issue

## ðŸš¨ **Issue Fixed**
- **Error**: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'U' before initialization`
- **Problem**: Circular dependency between seating components importing types from each other
- **Impact**: Venue images uploaded successfully but failed to render in browser

## âœ… **Solution Implemented**

### **Root Cause**
Components were importing both default exports and named type exports from the same files, creating circular dependency chains:
- `PremiumSeatingManager` exports both component and `SeatData`/`SeatCategory` types
- `SeatingChartWizard` imports component + types from `PremiumSeatingManager`
- `CustomerSeatingChart` exports types that get imported by other components
- This created a circular import loop causing the "Cannot access before initialization" error

### **Fix Applied**
1. **Created Separate Types File**: `/src/types/seating.ts`
   - Moved all seating-related type definitions to dedicated file
   - Prevents circular dependencies between component files

2. **Updated Import Statements**:
   - `PremiumSeatingManager.tsx`: Now imports types from `/types/seating`
   - `SeatingChartWizard.tsx`: Imports component separately from types
   - `CustomerSeatingChart.tsx`: Imports types from central location
   - `InteractiveSeatingChart.tsx`: Uses centralized types
   - `EventDetail.tsx`: Imports types from `/types/seating`

3. **Type Consolidation**:
   - `SeatData` interface with all properties (including extended ones)
   - `SeatCategory` interface for seat categories
   - `PriceCategory` interface for pricing tiers

## ðŸ”§ **Files Modified**
- âœ… **Created**: `/src/types/seating.ts` - Central type definitions
- âœ… **Updated**: `PremiumSeatingManager.tsx` - Import types externally
- âœ… **Updated**: `SeatingChartWizard.tsx` - Separate component/type imports
- âœ… **Updated**: `CustomerSeatingChart.tsx` - Use external types
- âœ… **Updated**: `InteractiveSeatingChart.tsx` - Use external types
- âœ… **Updated**: `EventDetail.tsx` - Import types separately

## ðŸš€ **Result**
- âœ… **Build passes**: No TypeScript errors
- âœ… **Circular dependency resolved**: Clean import structure
- âœ… **Image rendering fixed**: Venue images should now display properly
- âœ… **Seating functionality intact**: All seating features preserved

## ðŸŽ¯ **Testing Status**
The venue image upload was already working (logs showed successful Supabase upload), but the circular dependency was preventing the image from rendering in the browser. This fix should resolve the `Cannot access 'U' before initialization` error and allow venue images to display properly in the seating chart interface.

**Next Test**: Upload a venue image in premium event creation and verify it renders correctly without console errors.
